      <h2>About Me</h2>
    </div>
    <p>In case you haven't already noticed, my name is Luke. Originally from
    northern New Jersey, I'm currently a second year Computer Science
    major at Northeastern University in Boston. You can usually find me
    running somewhere around the city with the Men's Track Team at NU,
    or listening to music so that I have something to write about.</p>

    <p>If you're more interested in my personal history for whatever reason,
    feel free to get in touch.
    There's a number of different ways you can get in contact with me, and most
    of them can be found on this page.</p>

    <h3>TripLegal</h3>
    <p>TripLegal is a web based application that was designed for the TripAdvisor
      legal department, and is used to help manage litigation holds placed on
      employees. The backend API is written in Python and runs off of a Flask
      server. The application utilizes a PostgreSQL database, and the psycopg2
      library to allow the Flask server to interact with the database. The front end
      is written in Vanilla JS with the fetch library being used for HTTP calls. I
      also used the Bulma CSS framework to assist with some of the design.
    </p>
    <h3>TickerDisplay for Reddit</h3>
    <p>TickerDisplay is a chrome extension designed to work with the old
      Reddit design. I frequently browse several financial-related subreddits
      and found that I was opening a large number of tabs to check on how the
      company a post mentioned was doing. The chrome extension uses a content
      script to go through the page and generates a small bubble whenever a post
      mentions a ticker symbol, it displays the current price as well as the
      percentage or dollar change for that day, as specified by the user. Uses
      Google's chrome extension API, as well as the IEX API to retrieve live
      stock prices directly from the exchange. The github page for that
      project can be found <a>here</a>
    </p>
    <h3>Easy Animator</h3>
    <p>Class project for an Object Oriented Design class, the Easy Animator was
      a java application that, when given a properly formatted text file,
      converted the text file to an animation that could be looped, played back
      at different speeds, and exported to an SVG animation. Utilized Java's
      swing library for UI design. The github page for that project can be
      found <a>here</a></p>
    <h3>Current activities</h3>
    <p>I'm currently in the middle of a 6 month co-op at TripAdvisor! I will be working there
    until December, at which time I plan to return to classes at Northestern</p>
    <p>As far as side projects go, I've got a few things up my sleeve, but they're on hold for
      now until one of my work projects is up.

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
    </div>

    <h4>

    <h4>Where does nluken come from?</h4>
    <p>Well, obviously it's based on my name, hence the "luken", but the
      first n was something that I just liked because it made my steam
      username more symmetrical. Unfortunately, some people have beat me
      to the punch on some websites and it's not my username everywhere, but
      whenever I can get it, I go with nluken</p>

    <h4>I'm here for business, what can you do for me?</h4>
    <p>That's an excellent question that I'm more to happy to answer on
      <a href="Resume.html">this</a>
      page</p>

    <h4>What kind of skills do you have?</h4>
    <p>As far as programming goes, I've worked mostly with java, learning the design
      principles of object oriented programming. In addition, I've done some light
      web work with JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In addition to programming skill, I am currently in an IT related co-op
      position, being taught the ins and outs of IT. While I can't predict the
      future, I would say that it's pretty likely that I emerge from my 6 month
      stint at TripAdvisor with a lot of knowledge in that field</p>
    <p>Outside of programming, I dabble in graphic design and finance, especially
      when it comes to US equity markets. I love seeing my interests in finance and
      programming converge, so projects that involve that somehow are exceptionally
      fun to work on.</p>

    <h4>What kind of music do you listen to?</h4>
    <p>That can be hard to answer, because it changes so much. Your best bet
      is to follow my
      <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1296647833?si=e_0BJac6Sveyeq7q96er5w">
        Spotify account</a>
      but I'm also planning on starting a music reviewing blog soon too, so stay
      tuned for that.

      <h4>What's with this dog motif?</h4>
      <p>Do you have something against doooooooooooooooooogs?</p>

      <h4>Q: Are we not men?</h4>
      <p>A: We are DEVO!</p>
