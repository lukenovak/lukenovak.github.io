                    <p class="text-left">A little about me: On any given day, you might find me running along the Charles, listening to some music at a jazz club, or just reading a book at home. I'm currently based out of Brooklyn, specifically Bushwick, but I'm still in Boston (well, Somerville) about a week every month.</p>
                    <p class="text-left">I'm a software engineer by trade, but I also write and make music a bit in my spare time. I have broad and varying interests, but I like working on interesting projects, so please <a class="w-hover" href="mailto:contact@nluken.com">shoot me an email</a> if you've got something you think might pique my interest. <a href="assets/Luke-Novak-March-2024.pdf"><b>You can take a look at my résumé here</b></a> to get some idea of my professional experience.</p>

            <h5>a few places you might know me from:</h5>
            <div class="ml-3 mb-2 text-left">
                <li>Kargo: I currently work here, in New York.</li>
                <li>PathAI: I worked here for two years, from June of 2021 to July of 2023, where I built applications that improve cancer diagnosis and treatment. I also worked on open source projects like OpenSlide.</li>
                <li>Northeastern University: I graduated from Northeastern in May of 2021, where I built an AI model to analyze song lyrics, ran for the track team, wrote on how Marxist philosphy can be applied to digital personal data, and more. I also worked for the school as a Teaching Assistant for a Compiler Design course.</li>
                <li>WRBB 104.9: I DJed a show called No Credit on Boston's WRBB from the summer of 2019 to the spring of 2021. I went by the name "Logan Wellington" on the radio, and I still use that moniker when I DJ from time to time. If you're interested in what I played, you can check out my <a href="https://spinitron.com/WRBB/dj/139582/Logan-Wellington">spinitron profile</a> or <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/loganwellington/">listen to the live sets on mixcloud</a></li>
                <li>Apple: I worked for Apple as a software engineering co-op from June 2020 through January 2021</li>
                <li>TripAdvisor: I worked here for about a year, from July to December in both 2018 and 2019, where I started as a helpdesk tech and ended up as a software engineering co-op</li>
                <li>The running world: I run competitively, and ran in the NCAA from 2016-2021</li>
