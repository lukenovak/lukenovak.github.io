      <h2>About Me</h2>
    </div>
    <p>In case you haven't already noticed, my name is Luke. Originally from
    northern New Jersey, I'm currently a second year Computer Science
    major at Northeastern University in Boston. You can usually find me
    running somewhere around the city with the Men's Track Team at NU,
    or listening to music so that I have something to write about.</p>

    <p>If you're more interested in my personal history for whatever reason,
    feel free to get in touch.
    There's a number of different ways you can get in contact with me, and most of them can be found on this page.</p>

    <h4>Where does nluken come from?</h4>
    <p>Well, obviously it's based on my name, hence the "luken", but the
      first n was something that I just liked because it made my steam
      username more symmetrical. Unfortunately, some people have beat me
      to the punch on some websites and it's not my username everywhere, but
      whenever I can get it, I go with nluken</p>

    <h4>I'm here for business, what can you do for me?</h4>
    <p>That's an excellent question that I'm more to happy to answer on <a>this</a> page</p>

    <h4>What kind of skills do you have?</h4>
    <p>As far as programming goes, I've worked mostly with java, learning the design
      principles of object oriented programming. In addition, I've done some light
      web work with JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Outside of programming, I dabble in graphic design and finance, especially
      when it comes to US equity markets. I love seeing my interests in finance and
      programming converge, so projects that involve that somehow are exceptionally
      fun to work on.</p>

    <h4>What kind of music do you listen to?</h4>
    <p>That can be hard to answer, because it changes so much. Your best bet
      is to follow my
      <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1296647833?si=e_0BJac6Sveyeq7q96er5w">
        Spotify account</a>
      but I'm also planning on starting a music reviewing blog soon too, so stay
      tuned for that.

      <h4>What's with this dog motif?</h4>
      <p>Do you have something against doooooooooooooooooogs?</p>

      <h4>Q: Are we not men?</h4>
      <p>A: We are DEVO!</p>
